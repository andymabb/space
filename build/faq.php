Can I still do yoga?</h2><div data-content><p>Of course you can, indeed some conditions respond particularly well to certain yoga postures. As a new student you should always alert your teacher to any existing medical condition, or treatment you may be having. Certain classes and poses would not be appropriate for some people with particular injuries, illnesses or disabilities. We have a special restorative yoga class for people recovering from illness and injury. All our teachers also offer 1-2-1 sessions which have proven very effective for students with particular conditions such as recovery from cancer or undergoing chemotherapy treatment, for example.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I am pregnant / new mother and want to get back in shape &ndash; can yoga help?</h2><div data-content><p>Giving birth and bringing up children are central parts of a woman&rsquo;s life and yoga can make a big difference to the well being of mother and child. We run regular ante natal yogaand post natal yoga classes, have >Mother &amp; Baby Yoga &amp; Massage courses, Breathe to a Better Birth sessions and Hypnotherapy workshops. We also offer a great Pregnancy and Post-Natal package called &lsquo;The Ultimate Pregnancy &amp; Post-Natal Bundle of Joy&rsquo;. Get in touch with Ginny and she will direct you based on your needs. See the <a href="classes.php">Classes</a> page for more details</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I have a child / teenager who might be interested in yoga. Do you have a suitable class?</h2><div data-content><p>We run two teen yoga classes every week, and one children's yoga class for 8-12 years olds. We also run family yoga at weekends. We have found it benefits children who need to &lsquo;slow down&rsquo; and relax and those who are looking for an alternative form of physical exercise.<br>See <a href="classes.php">class descriptions</a> for the most suitable class.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I am a guy. I was thinking about yoga but am worried that most classes seem to be just for women.</h2><div data-content><p>While in Britain there are more female than male yoga students, yoga traditionally has been practised predominately by men. Most of the greatest yogis in the last century were men, and today some of our most gifted teachers are men. We have regular workshops run by some superb, inspirational teachers and Simon Stalley teaches two regular classes a week at The Space. We have a number of male students, and other than the mother/child classes specifically for mothers or mothers-to-be, men are welcome to attend any class and do! Our numbers of men are growing. We say &lsquo;real men do yoga&rsquo;!</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I don&rsquo;t understand about the different sorts of yoga and am not sure what to go for?</h2><div data-content><p>The beauty of the Space is that a wide range of classes and yoga styles are available for you to try. You can &lsquo;drop in&rsquo; and try any class or if you <a href="prices.php">buy a 5 or 10 class Space Card</a> you can use it for any class or workshop. In practice some students like mixing their practice around. Some like a particular teacher, others a certain kind of yoga; some of our students are chiefly led by the time and day that suits their schedule. There are a wide variety of classes taking place every day, most of the day, so the choice is yours. Have a look at the <a href="classes.php">class descriptions</a>, <a href="teachers.php">teachers&rsquo; profiles</a>, <a href="testimonials.php">testimonials</a>, and <a href="timetable.php">timetable</a> and choose!</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I am not sure how to get to you or where to park?</h2><div data-content><p>Go to the <a href="location.php">getting there page</a>.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I like to take classes regularly. What&rsquo;s the most cost effective way to do this?</h2><div data-content><p>You can &lsquo;drop in&rsquo; to any class, but the most cost effective way is to order a Space Class Card on-line or by phone making a card payment. You can also buy an &lsquo;annual membership&rsquo; to get a good deal. Have a look on our <a href="prices.php">Prices</a> page to choose the package that best suits you.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I want a particular therapy, which is not listed / a 1-2-1 session at home&hellip;</h2><div data-content><p>We are happy to arrange a customised practice routine or therapy, where possible at the studio or at home. Please call or <a href="mailto:info@thespacethame.com">email us</a> directly to arrange this.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>Do I need any special clothes for yoga?</h2><div data-content><p>All you need is comfortable, loose clothing that you can move in.<br>We practise barefoot, so we leave our shoes on the shoe rack outside the studio door. There are a range of stylish yoga clothes available but yoga has no uniform.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>What about equipment?</h2><div data-content><p>Some forms of yoga require props and equipment, and everyone needs a mat but these are all freely available from the studio. If you would like your own mat or yoga accessories they can be brought from the studio.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>I am worried I am too old &ndash; I don&rsquo;t want to be in a class of just young people?</h2><div data-content><p>Some of our most accomplished practitioners are older people, and many started later in life. We have one Golden Yoga class specifically for older people and many of the Classical Hatha Yoga and Iyengar Yoga classes are suitable, see the <a href="timetable.php">timetable</a> for your best class.</p></div></li><li data-accordion><h2 data-control>How can you help me with my personal practice?</h2><div data-content><p>To some extent your personal practice is of course your own. However customised 1-2-1s can help. We also have CD&rsquo;s and books you can buy, in particular <a href="products.php">One Pose a Day</a>, which is ideal for personal daily practice.</p></div></li></ul><p class="top"><a href="#" title="Top of the page"><svg class="icon icon-arrow-up2"><use xlink:href="#icon-arrow-up2"></use></svg><span>Top</span></a></p></div><!-- .main end --></main> <?php include("inc/footer.php"); ?> <script src="https://widgets.healcode.com/javascripts/healcode.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="build/js/jquery.accordion.min.js?t=1583262904839"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function() {
