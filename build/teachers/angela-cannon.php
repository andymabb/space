<h1>Angela Cannon</h1><img src="images/teachers/bio-pages/angela-cannon.jpg" alt="Angela Cannon" class="w350fr"><p>I have been practising Yoga for 20 years. For many years I did one class a week of Ashtanga Yoga. I loved the positive effects on my mind, body and soul. I qualified as a teacher in 2018 following my study with Fire Angel Yoga, which was a 200 hour course covering every area of Yoga theory and practise.</p><p>I now teach mainly Hatha Yoga for all levels. Most of my classes have a flow element based around Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations).</p><p>I love teaching beginners as it is very satisfying watching their progress and their enjoyment of all the benefits Yoga brings.</p>
