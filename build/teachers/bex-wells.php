It was there I discovered the power of yoga to positively influence both my physical and mental health. After Korea, I trained and received my teaching qualification with The International Yoga Ashram in Rishikesh, India.</p><p>Through Yoga my body has become stronger and more flexible but more importantly my mind is happier and more at peace. Yoga has given me the ability to accept, slow down and just be. In a fast-paced and often stressful world, our minds can become saturated with thoughts about the past and future plans. Yoga connects us to the abundance that exists in every moment and moves us away from fear and judgement to a place of acceptance and love.</p><p>My classes draw upon the use of asanas, pranayama, concentration exercises and mindfulness, with the intention of reducing mental scattering and enabling relaxation of the nervous system.</p><p>I like to give each class a different theme which often reflects what I have been learning. My intention is to create a non - judgmental and loving space where students feel comfortable to learn and deepen their practice at their own pace.</p>
