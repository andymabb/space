This type of yoga is good for strengthening the body, toning the body and burning calories. It also promotes mental wellbeing and by connecting the breath and movement enables you become 'present'. This can be continued both on and off the mat.</p><p>Carrie has been drawn to this type of yoga after practising vinyasa flow in Manhattan during the last 12 months where she accumulated over 700 hours of practice with experienced yogis.</p><p>Carrie has a Diploma in teaching yoga from London based YMCA and holds full public liability insurance.</p>
