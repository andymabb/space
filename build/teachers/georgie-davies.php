Not particularly sporty as a teenager Georgie found yoga to be the perfect way to challenge and soothe her body and in turn noted the mental as well as physical benefits. After a period of umming and ahhing Georgie completed her 200hr training with Sally Parkes, left her office life, went travelling and is now focused on passing her love of yoga onto others.</p><p>Her classes are welcoming, playful, challenging but relaxing and all about evolving your body and your mind. Georgie is passionate about making yoga as accessible and inclusive as possible, ensuring that the yoga mat should be the place in your day when only you and your personal experience matters.</p>
