<h1>Jo Ibbett</h1><img src="images/teachers/bio-pages/jo-ibbett.jpg" alt="Jo Ibbett" class="w350fr"><p>Jo has been teaching yoga since 2007 with over 1000hrs of training. She first began teaching in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and was one of the first teachers at the Wild Rose Studio. Initially she trained in two 200hr Yoga Alliance trainings in Hatha Yoga with Sara Avant Stover and Jonas Westring and Chakra Yoga (Gitananda Yoga tradition ICYER). Her love of bio-mechanics, philosophy and all things heart felt and devotional led her to becoming an Anusara Inspired yoga teacher in 2011. She has assisted Sara Avant Stover on Yoga Teacher Trainings, Jonas Westring on Anusara Immersions and studied intensively with Doug Keller, Ellen Heed, Sianna Sherman, Jason Nemer, and Uma Dinsmore-Tuli. Jo is a qualified Yoga Therapist, with Yoga Campus, and has an experienced background in Massage and Complementary Therapy. She is currently completing an MA in Psychotherapy (Integrative/Jungian) and Healing Practice. In both her teaching and personal practice Jo sees yoga as a space to reflect on our lives and begin to find balance between acceptance and positive change. Jo's classes are inspiring, uplifting, and come from the heart. Dedicated to supporting her students as they deepen their journey into self-enquiry, her classes offer a safe space to play, expand and grow.</p>
