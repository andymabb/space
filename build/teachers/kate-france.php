After battling anorexia and depression in my late teens and early 20s I began the journey of self-acceptation, which took me to India where I was awakened to this genuine practice of yoga once again (without the giggles). I saw how this incredible discipline not only gave me the ability to open and strengthen my body but mentally connected me to how I felt in each passing moment. Deciding to explore my mind was the hardest part of my new yoga discovery and I went to a 10 day silent vipassana meditation centre in Punjab to deepen this awareness, and positively challenge myself. This encouraged me to want to teach to others what I had unravelled&hellip;the capacity to self-sooth.</p><p>I completed my 200 Hours (yoga alliance) yoga teacher training in Ashtanga Vinyasa in India, Goa in March 2015. Then I went back in October to further my training where my Vinyasa flow creativity flourished. I also learnt how to balance the yang energy of strong yoga practices with the stillness of yin yoga classes. Currently I am training to be a Thai yoga Massage Therapist and next year I start my Yoga Therapy Training at the Minded Institute. The learning never stops!</p><p>Although we think of yoga as a physical practice, once you understand that the body is inseparable from the mind (emotions, thoughts) we realise that yoga is a gateway to purifying the soul, which stays with us on and off the mat. And yes, yoga is hard work, as is life, but by learning this ancient skill you are giving yourself the greatest gift.</p><p>My classes are always a reflection of what I am learning and I try to provoke creativity, commitment, compassion and constant change.</p>
