She then went on to experience the profound benefits of Yoga during and after the pregnancies of her three children and it was then that she felt compelled to train as a Yoga teacher. She did this with Fire Angel Yoga here at The Space, graduating in the spring of 2019.</p><p>In her classes, Lisa loves to explore the opposites that inevitably bring balance to the body and mind, such as dynamic sequences followed by deep relaxations. The need for flexibility to be supported by strength and stability in the body are focal points of her teaching practice.</p><p>Lisa Wishes to help her students get the most out of their yoga practice, whatever their needs and loves to guide people in relaxation and meditation so that they can experience the multi sensory benefits of yoga for body and mind.</p>
