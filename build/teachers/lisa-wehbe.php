The need for flexibility to be supported by strength and stability are focal points of her teaching practice as well as helping people to achieve a “rest and digest” state. Lisa wishes the people attending her classes to experience the multi-sensory benefits of yoga and so she always starts with a moment of tranquility, then builds intensity before winding back down into relaxation.</p><p>Lisa began to practice yoga to compliment her professional dance training over 20 years ago. She attended Asana/posture based classes under various different schools for many years before experiencing the profound benefits of Yoga for the mind throughout and after the pregnancies of her three children. It was during this time that she felt inspired to train as a Yoga teacher, which she did with Fire Angel Yoga here at The Space gaining her 200hrs qualification. Lisa then went on to complete her pre and postnatal teacher training and will also qualify as a Well Woman Yoga Therapist later this year.</p>
