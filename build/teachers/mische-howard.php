Having practiced yoga since the age of 15, it was when she became ill in her 20ʼs that yoga in its entirety really resonated and brought her to become the teacher she is today.</p><p>She studied her 200 hours in Hatha yoga at Semperviva Studio, Vancouver, Canada in 2014 and taught along side her ʻday jobʼ as a fashion designer. The stress of her job and illness took its toll and in 2018 she was forced her to slow her practice down. This is where Mische discovered the incredible benefits to restorative yoga.</p><p>After completing her restorative yoga teacher training with Anna Ashby at TriYoga London, Mische is eager to bring restorative to all, believing everyone needs a little restorative in todayʼs busy society. She is also studying Reiki and aims to combine the two healing practices. After practicing Kundalini under Gloria Latham whilst living in Canada, it was once on the healing journey that Mische found out how transformational the practice can really be and decided to study with Gloria in order to teach this energetic, life changing practice.</p><p>You can keep up to date with Mische @The_Re.Store on instagram and every Wednesday evening from February at The Space, Thame.</p>
