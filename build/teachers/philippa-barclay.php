<div class="teacher-header"><h1>Philippa Barclay</h1></div><img src="images/teachers/bio-pages/philippa-barclay.jpg" alt="Philippa Barclay" class="w350fr"><p>I have always had a love of practicing yoga and felt a yearning to begin my journey of becoming a yoga teacher whilst meditating at a yoga retreat in Thailand some years ago whilst taking some time out from my Corporate job.</p><p>I qualified as a 200hr instructor with Yoga London in 2015 in Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga. I have also taken yoga trainings in various other styles of Hatha yoga and in children and family yoga and mindfulness. More recently I decided to undertake my Yin yoga teacher training as Yin yoga is also a big part of my own personal practice and I enjoy inspiring people to find joy in the combination of both movement and stillness that can be found in our yoga practice.</p><p>I offer dynamic flowing yoga classes which provide a strong steady flow from posture to posture with a focus on energising the body with an awareness of our movement and breath. Combining this with a more grounding Yin practice to work towards increased mobility and developing more mindfulness in our practice.</p><p>In addition to yoga teaching I also have an interest in mindfulness and holistic health treatments and I am a Level 2 Reiki Practitioner and I have a strong belief in holistic and complimentary therapies in helping lead a healthy and balanced life.</p>
