I feel very fortunate to have such fabulous space on my doorstep.</p><cite><small>Carolyn (annual member)</small></cite></blockquote></li><li><h2>Iyengar Yoga</h2><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I've been going to The Space for just over a year and feel it is a warm and welcoming place.</p><p>Iyengar Yoga is known for its use of props, such as belts, blocks and bolsters and there is plenty of equipment in the studio.</p><p>I attend Clare's Iyengar class and find her to be an excellent yoga teacher who is well prepared and tailors her class to suit all abilities. She is attentive to all her pupils and her sense of fun makes every class a pleasure. The classes are not competitive in any way, but as students we are encouraged to challenge ourselves. &rdquo;</p><cite><small>Julia</small></cite></blockquote></li><li><h2>Classical Hatha Yoga</h2><blockquote>&ldquo;I have been practising yoga for 15 years and have attended Vicki's yoga class for the past three years. Her sense of humour, compassion and careful attention to every student allows for a relaxed and enjoyable environment in which to learn. She creates the perfect balance of breath work, meditation and postures. Her classes are charged with a positive energy which continually encourages and challenges me to further improve my practice, enabling me to connect more deeply with mind and body. I come away from Vicki's classes, not only feeling two inches taller, but also with a strengthened focus and sense of well-being.&rdquo; <cite><small>Stella</small></cite></blockquote></li><li><h2>Ante-Natal Yoga</h2><blockquote>&ldquo;'Keeping active and positive defineitely seemed to be the key for me and worked for both my birthing experiences. Your yoga sessions were particularly great at helping me to focus and connect with my baby. I feel really thrilled an relieved to have been able to have the kind of birth I was hoping for- in fact it was far better than I could have imagined!'&rdquo; <cite><small>Ante-Natal Yoga student at The Space</small></cite></blockquote></li><li><h2>Therapeutic Yoga</h2><blockquote>&ldquo;After many years of shoulder and neck pain and having tried numerous treatments including various types of massage eg shiatsu, physiotherapy, osteopathy, reflexology, I was resigned to having to live with not only the pain but feeling that the upper part of my body was weak and would only get weaker with age. However, within about 5 sessions of yoga with Ginny, my posture improved and it seemed my whole body felt stronger and the pain has certainly diminished. I will continue with yoga and look forward to my body getting even stronger and more flexible.&rdquo; <cite><small>Lucie Noble, age 55</small></cite></blockquote></li><li><h2>Yoga in Prison</h2><blockquote>&ldquo;I joined Yoga as NYAS said it may help me for something to do in my cell and may help my temper. I enjoyed going to Yoga as it got me out of my cell and have found it calms me down. I feel less aggressive and less stressed since I started. I would do Yoga in my cell if it was big enough but I have found it too small. When I get out I intend to carry on with Yoga as it would benefit me in being less stressed. It would also benefit me in my hobby boxing, with its breathing techniques and flexibility. I am very grateful for all the help from the yoga teachers for all their teachings and time.&rdquo; <cite><small>Luke Huntercombe YOI</small></cite></blockquote></li><li><h2>Dynamic Hatha Flow</h2><blockquote>&ldquo;As someone new to Yoga it was perhaps ambitious to join a Hatha flow class, but I was made to feel welcome, not patronised but supported. I have found my fitness and in particular my flexibility greatly improved. I look forward now to starting my week in a quiet, calm meditative way, have a really good workout and leave feeling inspired. After a dozen lessons I've now invested in my own Yoga Mat, so I'm in for the long haul!&rdquo; <cite><small>Tony</small></cite></blockquote></li></ul><p class="top"><a href="#" title="Top of the page"><svg class="icon icon-arrow-up2"><use xlink:href="#icon-arrow-up2"></use></svg><span>Top</span></a></p></div><!-- .main end --></main> <?php include("inc/footer.php"); ?> <script src="https://widgets.healcode.com/javascripts/healcode.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
