It is designed to meet the needs of the client by taking into consideration the state of the tissues underneath the therapist’s hands. By “melting” into tissues and paying attention to the tone and feel of muscles, those who have cancer can still enjoy the effects of an effective massage, without it placing a greater burden on a body system already under stress. Oncology massage may help to manage anxiety and insomnia, alleviate stress and decrease nausea, pain and fatigue associated with cancer treatment.

ScarWork uses light touch to help your scars feel and function better. It works to unstick the fascia around and underneath the Scars, promoting further healing. Often nerve pain, itching and sensitivity are reduced and mobility in the area increases. Visually your scar may look less prominent and appear flatter. Even people who do not like their scars being touched find that by progressing slowly towards the scar, at their own pace, promotes changes in sensitivity levels which allows for work to be done on the scar itself. Most scars, regardless of age, can be treated with ScarWork. The exceptions are keloid scars and stretch marks.</p><p>To book call <a href="#bianca-talyarkhan">Bianca Talyarkhan</a> on <a href="tel:07798848066">07798 848066</a> or email <a href="mailto:Biancatt@gmail.com">Biancatt@gmail.com</a></p></div></li></ul><h2 id="therapists">Hire the Healing Room</h2><img src="images/therapy-room.jpg" alt="The healing room" class="fl"><p>The Healing Room is available for hire to qualified therapists at attractive rates:</p><ul class="dl"><li><span>1 hour</span> <span>&pound;10</span></li><li><span>2 hours</span> <span>&pound;18</span></li><li><span>3 hours</span> <span>&pound;25</span></li><li><span>4 hours</span> <span>&pound;30</span></li></ul><p>If you would like to hire the Healing Room, please contact Ginny on:<br>07791 165998 or 01558 650572.</p><h2>Our Therapists</h2><div class="therapists-bios"><h3 id="ginny-moffett" class="therapist-name">Ginny Moffett</h3><div class="therapist-text"><p>Ginny Moffett trained as a Reflexologist with the Bayly School of Reflexology, qualifying in 1989.</p><p>She has been practising for over 25 years and strongly believes in the healing and therapeutic benefits of this complimentary therapy.</p><p><strong>Call: <a href="tel:07791165998" class="therapist-tel">07791 165998</a></strong></p><hr></div><img src="images/treatments/ginny-moffett-sq.jpg" alt="Ginny Moffett"><h3 id="vicky-austin" class="therapist-name">Vicky Austin</h3><div class="therapist-text"><p>Vicki Austin is an Ayurvedic Diet & Lifestyle Consultant (as well as an experienced yoga teacher) and offers consultations in The Healing Room.</p><p>She completed a Diploma in Ayurveda Diet & Lifestyle (August 2014) at Ayurveda Pura under the expert tutelage of Dr Deepa Apte.</p><p><strong>Call: <a href="tel:07947149675" class="therapist-tel">07947 149675</a></strong></p><hr></div><img src="images/treatments/vicki-austin.jpg" alt="Vicki Austin"><h3 id="vicky-page" class="therapist-name">Vicky Page</h3><img src="images/treatments/vicki-page-sq.jpg" alt="Vicky Page"><div class="therapist-text"><p>Vicki is qualified in 'No Hands' Massage, Reflexology, Aromatherapy Massage, Indian Head Massage, Aromatherapeutic Facials and is a Reiki Master.
