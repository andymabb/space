It is an old system that includes the practice of asanas (yoga postures) and pranayama (breathing exercises), which help bring peace to the mind and body, preparing the body for deeper spiritual practices such as meditation.</p><p>The term hatha is used in such a broad way that it is difficult to know what a particular hatha class will be like. In most cases, however, it will be relatively gentle, slow and great for beginners or students who prefer a more relaxed style where they hold poses longer.</p></li><li><h2>Vinyasa</h2><p>Like hatha, vinyasa is a general term that describes many different styles of yoga. It essentially means movement synchronized with breath and is a vigorous style based on a rapid flow through sun salutations. Vinyasa may also be referred to as a flow class, which refers to the continuous flow from one posture to the next.</p></li><li><h2>Ashtanga</h2><p>Ashtanga is a system of yoga that was brought to the modern world by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. If you attend an ashtanga class at a studio you will be led non-stop through one or more of the ashtanga series, while being encouraged to breathe as you move from pose to pose. Each series is a set sequence of asanas, always in the same order. It is typically fast-paced, vigorous and physically challenging.</p><p>There are six series in total, increasing in difficulty as you move from the primary series on.</p></li><li><h2>Iyengar</h2><p>The trademark of iyengar is the intense focus on the subtleties of each posture. In a typical iyengar class, poses are held much longer than in other schools of yoga, in an effort to pay closer attention to the precise musculoskeletal alignment within each asana. Another trademark of iyengar is the use of props, such as blocks, belts, bolsters, chairs and blankets, which are used to accommodate injuries, tightness or structural imbalances, as well as teach the student how to move into a posture properly.</p></li></ul><p class="top"><a href="#" title="Top of the page"><svg class="icon icon-arrow-up2"><use xlink:href="#icon-arrow-up2"></use></svg><span>Top</span></a></p></div><!-- .main end --></main> <?php include("inc/footer.php"); ?> <script src="https://widgets.healcode.com/javascripts/healcode.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
