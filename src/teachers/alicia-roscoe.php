<p>Alicia originally trained in Ashtanga yoga and has subsequently studied with traditional Hatha yoga teachers, as well as focusing on creative sequencing for vinyasa flow classes. Alicia loves to include philosophy, poetry, pranayama, vinyasa and meditation in her classes and to bring lightness and playfulness wherever possible. Alicia teaches with full presence, humility and an open heart. Gently asking her students to take a break from ‘real’ life and help them open the doors into their true nature and let the light in. She is passionate about helping people discover the beauty of the practice of yoga, to live their dreams and realise their full potential to live a happy and harmonic life. </p>
