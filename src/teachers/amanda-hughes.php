<p>Hi, my name is Amanda and I have been practising yoga for 15 years. I trained in 2012 with Frog Lotus International in Spain, studying Vinyasa Flow Yoga. Yoga simply changed my life and I'm passionate about sharing this beautiful, freeing experience with anybody who gets on a yoga mat. In my classes, expect a creative, intuitive flowing sequence (vinyasa) aiming to break boundaries and dissolve layers of tension with a few smiles along the way!</p>
