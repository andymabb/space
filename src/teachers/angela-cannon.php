<p>I came to a consistent Ashtanga practice 8 years ago after dipping in and out of it for some years. I found it was one of the few things that made me feel happy both in body and mind. The practice also helps keep me fit, supple and calm and made a big difference recovering from from two difficult pregnancies.</p>
<p>I qualified in 2018 with Ginny Moffett on the Fire Angel Yoga 200 Hour Teacher Training course. This has deepened my knowledge and love of the practice.</p>
