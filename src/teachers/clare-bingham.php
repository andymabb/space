<p>Clare began practising Iyengar Yoga in 2003 and is a member of the Iyengar Yoga Association (IYA) UK. Clare has held the internationally recognised Iyengar Yoga Certification Mark since October 2010 . Clare has been taught by senior Iyengar yoga teachers who have studied directly with BKS Iyengar in Pune, India. Clare is also a member of and the representative for the Oxford and Region Iyengar Yoga Institute (ORIYI). Iyengar Yoga, yoga in action, strengthens and tones the body, creates suppleness and flexibility and improves posture. It helps concentration and quietens the mind to promote well-being. The verbal instructions given in Iyengar yoga bring attention to detail in the yoga poses by focusing on the correct alignment of the body and the correct action in each pose. The precise nature of Iyengar yoga leads to a quality of movement enabling the body to move safely whilst working within its boundaries. The benefits from the poses practised have a range of differing qualities from grounding, energising, strengthening and stimulating to rejuvenating, calming and relaxing. Clare aspires to the progressive nature of Iyengar yoga which enables all ages and levels to work towards the full pose. The regular practice of Iyengar yoga can improve the body's condition and encourage improved health and well-being. </p>
