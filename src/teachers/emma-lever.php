 --><p>Emma discovered yoga three years ago during her adventures through Latin America, where she became interested in holistic living and yoga philosophy.</p>
<p>She found herself deepening her own practice with a variety of styles and practicing with teachers from all over the world. In 2016, she travelled to India to complete her 200-hour Hatha Yoga Teacher training, and to learn Vipassana meditation in Nepal, before returning to Guatemala to teach English and yoga at a Montessori school.</p>
<p>Emma has since returned to India, to practice with Hatha yoga teacher Surrinder Singh and to delve further into Eastern philosophy.</p>
<p>Emma offers a slow and meditative classical Hatha yoga class, focussing on connecting breath with movement to bring us to our natural state of peace, stillness and relaxation.</p>
