<p>Ginny Moffett, also known as <a href="http://www.fireangelyoga.com">Fire Angel</a>, has been teaching and practising Classical Hatha Yoga for over 30 years. She trained in London in 1986 with Frances Houlahan  and attended regular classes at the Sivananda Centre.  In 1989 she trained to teach Vinyasa Ashtanga Yoga with Ganga White and Tracey Rich at the White Lotus Foundation in California, and later qualified with the British Wheel of Yoga.</p>
<p>Her style of yoga is a blend of Classical Hatha Yoga and Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, a mix of the vigorous and the gentle, the ancient and the new. She is deeply grateful to the many teachers who have inspired her yoga path : David Williams, Danny Paradise, John Scott, Sandy Chubb, Manu Rossi, to name but a few.</p>
<p>Ginny opened The Space, Yoga &amp;  Healing Studio in Thame, Oxfordshire in 2009 offering a wide variety of yoga classes to suit all abilities.</p>
<p>Her practice material <a href="products.php#one-pose"><em>One Pose A Day</em></a> offers students a simple practice routine over a month.</p>
<p>Ginny enjoys her work with the <strong>elderly</strong>, and has developed a close relationship with <strong>Abbeyfield</strong> – a residential care home. She teaches those who are well into their nineties and has developed a seated yoga exercise routine especially for this age group.</p>
<p>Her CD <a href="products.php#keepit"><em>Keep it All Moving</em></a> has enabled those who cannot get to her classes to benefit from her expertise.</p>

<p>Ginny has taught yoga in <strong>prison</strong>, particularly through the <strong>Prison Phoenix Trust</strong>. Ginny believes yoga and meditation provide an opportunity to teach prisoners and particularly young offenders techniques for managing difficult emotions in challenging circumstances and an opportunity for introspection in order to make positive personal changes.</p>
<p>Ginny has written an illustrated children’s yoga <a href="http://www.fireangelyoga.com/publications.php#mountain"><em>Strong as a Mountain, Supple as a Snake</em></a>. Regular children’s workshops for Strong as a Mountain, Supple as a Snake ‘are held at the studio.</p>
<p>Ginny is also a qualified <strong>Reflexologist</strong> with the <strong>Bayly School of Reflexology</strong> and has been practising for over 25 years. She strongly believes in the healing and therapeutic benefits of this complimentary therapy.</p>
<p>Ginny offers a yoga practice suitable for the <strong>corporate</strong> world with particular attention given addressing to stress management, relaxation, fitness and nutrition.  Her clients include the <strong>US Peace Corps</strong>, <strong>International Red Cross</strong>, <strong>Tesco Group</strong>, <strong>Amey</strong>, <strong>Wragge &amp; Co</strong>. and <strong>The Tonic</strong>.</p>
<p>Ginny presently offers classes, workshops and retreats at the studio and abroad.</p>
