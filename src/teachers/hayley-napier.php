<p>Hayley first discovered yoga just over 7 years ago, whilst searching for some inner peace in her hectic London life. Since then she has become extremely passionate about her practice and decided in 2015 to take her yoga to the next level by carrying out a 200HR teacher training in Thailand in Hatha Yoga at Marina Yoga, Ao Nang.</p>
<p>Once qualified, Hayley travelled throughout India to understand the roots and traditions of this ancient practice more deeply, visiting the Himalayas, staying at the Anand Prakash Ahsram in Rishikesh and then teaching in Goa at Shiva Shakti Yoga Shala in Arambol. She is particularly interested in the power that yoga can have to relax people and help them to better listen to and understand the needs of their bodies and minds.</p>
