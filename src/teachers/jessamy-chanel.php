<p>I found my way to my Yoga practice through attending a wonderful weekly Pregnancy Yoga class (with Ginny Moffett at the Space!) which enabled me to see my changing body positively, learn about postures to support pregnancy and birth, learn how to relax and establish a daily meditation practise.</p>

<p>I have since completed my YTT 200 with Yoga Quota, Oxford, training in a contemporary Vinyasa Flow style with secondary focuses on Yin, Restorative and Accessible Yoga. Yoga Quota has at its core an ethos of inclusion and accessibility and works with a network of Teachers to spread the benefits of Yoga to those who need it most.</p>

<p>As a childrenâ€™s Occupational Therapist I regularly draw on Yoga philosophy, Pranayama( breathwork) and Asana (bodywork)to empower all individuals to try Yoga and enjoy the accessible and therapeutic benefits it offers. I am keen to increase the availability of classes which have an accessible approach. My classes aim to be trauma sensitive, inclusive, embody cultural and social sensitivity and awareness, and cultivate health and safety.</p>
