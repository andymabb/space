<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Jilli, I trained in Power Vinyasa yoga at a Baptiste certified studio, The House of Yoga, based in London in January 2016, having practised for 13 years. My training specialised in a Power Vinyasa style of yoga and particularly the 'Journey into Power' sequence. The asana or physical parts of the practice are inspired by the teachings of Krishnamacharya and his students Iyengar and Desikachar. Baron took what he learned from these great Eastern teachers and created a style of yoga that worked to empower, strengthen and stretch the bodies of modern Westerners. To compliment the yang practice of vinyasa, I trained with Sarah Lo and am now a certified Yin yoga teacher too, thereby creating equanimity.</p>
<p>I am also a Registered Children&rsquo;s Yoga teacher, completing my 95 hour training with YogaBeezs. This training combined Yoga with a Montessori background and approach thereby exploring how to develop the WHOLE child through yoga.</p>
<p>I came to a consistent yoga practice late in life. I am not sure whether I found it or it found me. My training has led to a journey of possibility, inspiration and discovery both on and off the mat. I am a certified business coach, facilitator and chartered accountant. I also love to tell stories. I invite you to share this journey with me as a student/teacher of life.</p>
