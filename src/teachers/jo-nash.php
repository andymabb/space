<p>Jo started yoga as a teenager after reading books by Tara Fraser, developing a self-practice at home.  After discovering Ashtanga with Digby Platt in Leamington Spa in 2010 and noticing the positive effects on her mental well-being, she became a devoted yoga practitioner.  Her practice deepened after being diagnosed with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS), and yoga acted as a therapy.</p>
<p>Jo is currently completing her 200 hour YTT with Ginny Moffett, and wishes to pass on the therapeutic effects of yoga in her teachings.  Her main aims are to help her students achieve what they previously thought impossible: whether an asana or a more relaxed state of being.</p>
