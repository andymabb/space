	<p>I started  to practice Yoga in my late 20's. After years of curiosity I finally dared to go to a class. I loved it and it became a regular practice straight away. I had lower back problems, bad posture and other minor health issues. It didn't take very long to realise an improvement in my physical health and I also started experiencing other benefits.</p>
