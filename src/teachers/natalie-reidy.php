<p>Natalie began her yoga journey 20 years ago . Her practice has become a beautiful tool for guidance, strength, clarity of mind and peacefulness. She has a PG Dip in Psychoanalytic Observation from The Tavistock Centre; a study of child to adult development which considers how our attachments and experiences shape how we perceive the world around us.  Through her yoga practice she is drawn to the link between the body, mind and soul, seeing them weaved together for the ultimate joy and peace.</p>
<p>Natalie is currently teacher training with Fire Angel, Ginny Moffett and her classes will cover the whole spectrum of yoga to include asana (postures),  moving meditation, pranayama, mantra and relaxation. Each class will have a spiritual emphasis.</p>
