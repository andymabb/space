<p>From Opera Singer, to Head of HR to Yoga Teacher. I have recently relocated from London to Britwell Salome. Firstly, to enjoy the space and freedom the countryside gives us, secondly, to give my family a life away from the confines and pressures of London and thirdly, to give myself time to enjoy my first year of motherhood.</p>
<p>I have been practising yoga for over 10 years, beginning in Sri Lanka. I started with the hope of becoming stronger and a little more flexible, but it afforded me all that and more. Flexibility, sure. Strength, absolutely. Clarity of mind, strength of character and a re-evaluation of my life was unexpected.</p>
<p>I practised Yoga every day of my pregnancy and returned to it after 6 days. I found the time on my mat to be comforting for both Tattie and I. The breathing techniques I still use to calm and sooth her. Both my body and mind are stronger because of Yoga and enable me to cope with anything she throws my way. Which is why I decided to specialise in Pregnancy and post-natal yoga. To give strength to expectant and new mums in what is often a daunting time.</p>
<p>I hope I can help you find all this as you start your journey to motherhood and beyond!</p>
